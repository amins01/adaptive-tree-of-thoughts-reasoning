Task:
Determine the very next concrete and actionable step required to solve the problem. Your next reasoning step must:

Focus on logic, calculations, or mathematical formulations that directly advance the problem. Avoid general phrases or descriptions.
Address one clear aspect of the problem at a time without combining multiple steps into one.
Introduce a distinct idea not already covered in the sibling reasoning steps provided above.
Example of an ideal next step:

If solving an equation: Simplify a specific term or isolate a variable.
If performing calculations: Compute or estimate a value for a specific part of the problem.
If proving something: Deduce or derive the next logical statement.
Write your next reasoning step clearly, using mathematical expressions or computations where possible.
